					<h4>Crispy Crab Cake Burger (Php 170)</h4>
					<p>The costumers enjoyed the Classic Quarter Pounder so much that they wanted to try more of our dishes. Soon as they took the last bite of my roll, they immediately ordered this crispy crab cake burger.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text2">
					<h4>Classic Quarter Pounder (Php 200)</h4>
					<p>The costumers enjoyed the Classic Quarter Pounder which tastes every bit as good as it looks. There’s a good balance between the colder crab spread and the warm scallops too.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text3">
					<h4>Grilled Cheese (Php 150)</h4>
					<p>Cheese sandwiches commonly referred to as a grilled cheese sandwich or a cheese toastie, are sandwiches that can be grilled so that the bread toasts and the cheese melts. It is also one of the favorite of our costumers because of its cheese overload.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="text4">
					<h4>Modern Burger (Php 150)</h4>
					<p>Our burger is consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, or flame broiled.</p>

					<h4>Indoor S'mores (Php 120)</h4>
					<p>With our indoor s'mores you still get that gooey marshmallow, melted chocolate, crunchy graham cracker treat anytime you want it. S'mores are a traditional campfire treat in North America, with a roasted marshmallow, sandwiched with a piece of chocolate between two pieces of graham crackers.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text6">
					<h4>Churros (Php 110)</h4>
					<p>This quaint churreria is a neighborhood hit in our cafe. Perfectly fried and golden brown, each piece starts with a resounding crunch before giving way to a pillow-soft, melt-in-your-mouth interior. Pair your churros with our hot chocolate: Dark, sweet, and comfortingly rich.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text7">
					<h4>Halo-Halo (Php 90)</h4>
					<p>Our halo-halo is a deliciously sweet, well-balanced version of the classic. The dessert is completed by topping a scoop or two of crushed ice, and drizzled with honey and evaporated milk. For a more special version, you can add ice cream, leche flan, or ube halaya.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="text8">
					<h4>Turon (Php 90)</h4>
					<p>Bananas are common in the country regardless of the season so you can find this local dessert all year round. Most locals prefer to eat turon during afternoon siesta or it can serve as snacks when entertaining a guest. It can either be paired with a hot or cold drink.</p>

					<h4>Chocolate Cake (Php 150)</h4>
					<p>Not only is a slice of Chocolate Cake one of the largest you’ll see in our cafe;  it’s also incredibly dense and rich. With picture-perfect layers of cake to icing, a slice strikes the right balance between decadently chocolatey. You’ll want a whole cake to take home for all your chocolate cravings.</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text10">
					<h4>Sans Rival (Php 150)</h4>
					<p>Sans Rival which means without rival lives very true to its name. With scrumptious layers of nutty meringue, creamy French buttercream, and chopped cashews, this Filipino dessert cake is far from ordinary!</p>
				</div>
					
				<div class="text11">
					<h4>Mango Float (Php 130)</h4>
					<p>Mango Float is the Filipino version of the Italian Tiramisu. However, instead of ladyfingers dipped in coffee and layered with a delicious and creamy mixture of other ingredients, the Mango Float uses local ingredients: a local brand of Graham crackers, condensed milk, heavy cream, and its main source of flavor – mango.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="text12">
					<h4>Leche Flan (Php 100)</h4>
					<p>Our cafe makes use of a sweeter type of milk, the condensed milk and is mixed with eggs then baked (or steamed). A caramelized top is a signature look of this delicious cream egg custard. While the ingredients are simple, this pinoy dessert is often served during very special occasions.</p>
