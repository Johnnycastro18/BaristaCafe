				<div class="KAREKARE">
					<h1>Crispy Pork Kare-Kare (Php 150)</h1>
					<p>The Crispy Pork Kare-Kare is a must-try: huge chunks of pork smothered in peanut sauce, served on a bed of vegetables with some homemade bagoong alamang (sauteed shrimp paste) and steamed rice. The kare-kare is so good, the portion very generous—although admittedly, We prefer saltier bagoong in my kare-kare.</p>

				<div class="RICEBOWL">
					<h1>Bagnet Rice Bowl (Php 120)</h1>
					<p>We specialize in Filipino rice bowls topped with favorites like tapa (thinly sliced marinated beef), pares (beef simmered in sweet soy and anise), and chicken adobo flakes. But their best bowl perhaps, and the one you should try considering the region, is this bagnet rice bowl (PHP 120). It’s a supremely crispy deep-fried pork belly dish that hails from the Ilocos region, which is the province just north of La Union. Bagnet is probably one of the crispiest pork belly dishes you’ll ever have in your life. It’s delicious.</p>

				<div class="ORIGINAL">
					<h1>Barista Original (Php 110)</h1>
					<p>Behold the Barista Original served with handcut fries and their own homemade banana ketchup. Bottled banana ketchup is too sweet for me but Sabong’s homemade version was perfect. It tasted of banana and tomato without being unnaturally sweet. The fried chicken was delicious too. Even the white meat was moist. Every 3-pc platter of fried chicken comes with either plain rice or chicken rice.</p>

				<div class="ADOBO">
					<h1>Adobo (Php 150)</h1>
					<p>This classic adobo recipe is simple to make and famous with all who have tasted it. It has been modified to be a bit more saucy than traditional adobo, it is delicious served over rice. The bright flavors in this recipe will surprise you when you realize you hardly need any special ingredients to make it! It’s delicious and it’s no wonder it’s one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines!</p>

				<div class="SINIGANG">
					<h1>Sinigang Pork (Php 130)</h1>
					<p>Sinigang is a sour soup native to the Philippines. This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. Other proteins and seafood can also be used. Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.</p>

				<div class="INIHAW">
					<h1>Inihaw na Liempo (Php 150)</h1>
					<p>Inihaw na Liempo is known as Grilled Pork Belly in Filipino. This dish needs no introduction at all because the name of the dish already introduces itself. Inihaw na Liempo is also a popular and favorite dish in the Philippines; in fact, there were several dishes that makes use of this dish as its component. Sinuglaw and Special Tokwat baboy are few of the examples.</p>

				<div class="PORK">
					<h1>Pork Barbeque (Php 100)</h1>
					<p>Filipino pork barbecue is popular street food in the Philippines as well as a regular mainstay at parties and special gatherings. Commonly peddled at street corners on makeshift grill carts, these delectable pork skewers are widely enjoyed as a viand with hefty servings of rice or as portable appetizers to complement cold beer. Like most mainstream dishes, every Filipino cook or household has their versions of barbecue pork. While calamansi or lemon juice appears to be standard for most Filipino pork barbecue recipes, I use vinegar instead to help tenderize the meat.</p>

				<div class="INASAL">
					<h1>Chicken Inasal (Php 120)</h1>
					<p>Chicken Inasal is a grilled chicken dish and one of the well known Ilonggo dishes. This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique blend of spices and grilling them until done. Sounds like a simple grilled chicken recipe, isn’t it? Well, it might sound like one; however, the special marinade and basting sauce makes this Ilonggo version of the grilled chicken extra special.</p>

				<div class="SISIG">
					<h1>Sisig (Php 100)</h1>
					<p>Sizzling Sisig makes a great party appetizer as well as a hearty dinner entree. The perfect blend of tangy, savory and spicy, it has all the bold, delicious flavors you’ll love! Sizzling sisig is a Kapampangan delicacy usually served as an appetizer but has evolved over the years into a popular dinner entree. Although traditionally made with grilled pig face and ears, different adaptations using flaked fish, seafood, and other cuts of meat such as chicken and crispy lechon kawali are also common.</p>

				<div class="BISTEK">
					<h1>Bistek Tagalog (Php 130)</h1>
					<p>Bistek Tagalog or the Filipino beef steak is a delicious blend of salty, sour, and sweet flavours. Thinly sliced beef is marinated in a mixture of mainly soy sauce and kalamansi, fried, and then topped with caramelised onions. The onions are just sweet enough to cut into and balance the strong salty and acidic tastes infused into the meat.</p>
