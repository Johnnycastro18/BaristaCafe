					<h1>El Union Coffee</h1>
					<p>El Union Coffee, a laidback and hip café found along the highway of San Juan, is a favorite destination for anyone’s much-needed caffeine fix. Upon entering their charming little spot, you’d feel that it’s very cozy, much like you’re in a boho-themed café without the usual restaurant setup you’d find in Manila. It’s a relaxing casual spot which can accommodate just about 10 to 20 persons at a time, making it a bit more intimate. It’s a place where you can meet new friends over good coffee, or you can also enjoy your cup alone</p>

					<h1>Clean Beach Coffee</h1>

They serve good coffee, delicious food (The Kaya Toast is heaven!), in an open-air lounge you can spend hours in. They even have beach chairs you can borrow, so you can pull one up to watch the sunset, with your iced coffee in hand.This beachside cafe was conceptualized by a group of locals and avid surfers, headed by Camille Pilar and Harold Crisostomo.

					<h1>Cafe Esperanza</h1>
					<p>Cafe Esperanza has been around since 1983, and the place has been thriving ever since. It has become quite a local landmark in the small city. The place offers such a cozy and homey atmosphere with just enough Instagrammable vintage accents that will make you feel like you’ve traveled to the past. The place also has a very distinct Filipino-style design that reflects the food that they offer. Cafe Esperanza serves traditional Filipino all-day breakfast meals, including beef tapa, Vigan longanisa, and pork tocino. However, aside from classic Filipino dishes, this restaurant is also known for their native delicacies, traditional Filipino snacks, and pastries.</p>
